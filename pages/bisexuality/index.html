<h3>Girls</h3>
<p>You may have heard the news; the bis aren't doing so well. </p>
<ul><li>We have more mood disorders such as depression, as well as anxiety disorders.</li>
<li>We have higher rates of hypertension, poor health, smoking and risky drinking.</li>
<li>We are far more likely to feel suicidal than heterosexuals, gay men, and lesbian women.</li>
<li>We're less likely to be out, and more likely to experience discrimination from our friends.</li></ul>
<p>
So that sucks, and that's enough reason to spill some ink on the subject, I suppose. But the real drive behind the zine you're holding wasn't dry stats, but rage, because of course. I got angry about the backlash to [a] pop song by Rita Ora (not an artist I previously had an opinion on) because that song spoke to something in me. And it got apnned as homophobic, biphobic and harmful to the LGBT+ community.<br>
Rita Ora and friends rap and sing about being "50/50" and not hiding it, kush loving, drinking wine and kissing girls. The lyrics were described as "obviously problematic". Lesbian pop star Hayley Kiyoko said: <br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [...] Every so often there come certain songs with messaging that is just downright tone-deaf, which does more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community. A song like this just fuels the male gaze while marginalizing the idea of women loving women. [...] I don't need to drink wine to kiss girls; I've loved women my entire life. This type of message is dangerous because it completely belittles and invalidates the very pure feelings of an entire community.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Internet comments on the lyrics were even more scathing. </p>
<blockquote><p>
  What are you talking about? An Anthem for bisexuality?! This song is only about sexualizing women, that has nothing to do with love and sexual orientation. The lyrics are disgusting, but I'm not surprised. They come from people who see themselves only as nothing more than a body. It's ashaming that women see other women this way. "A kitten"?! What is wrong with you people?! This is just like a sexist man sees a girl like a sexual toy. A girl is more than that. This song makes me sick. <br>

</p></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><p>On behalf of my fellow bisexuals, I'm rejecting this as our "anthem".
</p></blockquote>
<p>Editor's note: you can still read all about this 8 year old controversy by searching for the lyrics to <a href="https://genius.com/Rita-ora-girls-lyrics" target="_blank">Rita Ora - Girls</a>. </p>

<blockquote><p>Great more poeple sexualising bisexuality.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This song is trash.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I hope I speak for everyone when I say this song is not a real bisexual anthem. I'm bi and this really annoys me. Stop turning an orientation into a fetish. We're real people
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, Rita Ora, who clarified the song reflects her own experiences with women, is not a real person. And her feelings don't count as "very pure". And singing a song about partying, hooking up and sex - that's most songs in this genre - is "disgusting" and has nothing to do with love and sexual orientation.<br>
It seems that for a bisexual woman, it's not enough to come out by recording a hit song about the same things other pop starts sing about, you have to be pure, make sure you don't sexualise yourself, and that you don't "feed the male gaze" (it's a ravenous beast, you guys). It's not good enough to just be out there, visible and honest about your love of wine, kush and loving ladies.<br>
You see, if you want to be out and bi, you have to make sure you're a <em>good</em> bisexual: monogamous, relationship oriented, with pure and good feelings, not disgusting sexy ones, and be secure in your identity without phasing and wavering and also be clean and sober and don't ever cheat or fuck up. Basically, be perfect. <br>
Because otherwise you're just feeding the "negative" stereotypes of bisexuals, and that means it's also <em>your</em> fault that society doesn't have time for bisexuals.<br>
The noise about <em>Girls</em> has come and gone as I write this, and I may be the only one still upset about it. But it made me think, and write, a bunch of stuff that turned into this zine.<br>
Bi websites and organisations are often very concerned with stereotypes, so concerned that they risk alienating the many bisexuals who happen to meet (some of) those stereotypes. In this zine, I'm dreaming of a better way, where we embrace our stereotypes and the people that represent them, instead of hiding the freaks at the back.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<h3>A definition</h3>
<p>A lot of people seem to think of bisexuality as being "in between" het- and homosexuality. Hence "OK, but do you lean more this way or the other?"</p>
<P>I prefer to think of it as <em>both</em>. Both hetero and homo, perhaps at different times, perhaps in different ways, but the <em>potential</em> is there, always.</p>
<p>And that means that, much like a gay person who is single and not looking is still gay, a bi person in a relationship with someone of a gender is still bi.</p>
<p>

  <dd>attracted to people of other genders than oneself..</dd>
  <dt>Homosexual</dt>

  <dd>both is good.</dd>

<h3>Phase</h3>
<p>Many sites and pamphlets on the pleasures and discontents of bisexuality list "it's a phase" as one of the harmful myths and stereotypes people have about bisexuality.<br>
It supports bi erasure and the denial of bisexuality as a "valid" sexual orientation, because it allows biphobes to dismiss any real life evidence of bisexuals existing in the world by saying - oh, you'll grow out of it.<br>
On the other hand, for some people, bisexuality <em>is</em> a phase. Or was a phase for them, when they were figuring themselves out. Awkward, but true.<br>
For some folks, sexuality is clear cut - they know who they are and what they want and it doesn't change or confuse them. For many of us, it's not that simple, and we may try on a few different labels before settling, or continue to reinvent ourselves throughout our lives.<br>
There's nothing wrong with that. This isn't a problem.<br>
The problem is not so much that bisexuality is a phase (for some) but that people use this to dismiss us, deny the importance of our experience and refuse to take us seriously.<br>
Just because something is temporary doesn't mean it's not important. Brad Pitt's marriages are just a phase, we took them seriously enough, as a culture.

<blockquote><p>I was strongly attracted to gay men, but smart enough to realise that was not gonna work. Androgyny excited me, in men as well as women. In the late nineties, I didn't have the vocabulary to describe what I was, or what I was after, but I figured the local gay/lesbian scene probably had something to offer.</p>
<p>I was shy though. It may have been my third time in a bar of any kind, ever. I spoke to a guy who told me how great the place was on the weekend, when it was heaving with people, which sounded like hell. I let a girl buy me a drink, but the conversation was awkward and I didn't know how I felt about her. I felt like a fake. I got scared and went home.</P></blockquote>

<h3>Don't you just hate it when girls make out just to get attention from guys?</h3>
<p>No actually.</p>
<p>I like doing that. It's hot to be watched. It's hot to know a watcher is getting hot watching you get hot because they're watching. It's a hotness loop!</P>
<p>Sure, this is the only bisexuality that gets any media airtime, and <em>that's</em> a problem, but let's take a moment to remember bi women <em>aren't the reason for that problem.</em> That's not our fault.</p>
<p>And let's remember that if some douchebro gets overexcited when you say you're bi, or gives you a creepy "ooh, can I watch" vibe when you're just trying to have a drink with your girlfriend, that douche is being a douche.</p>
<p>Men being over-entitled and thinking female queer sexuality is all about <em>them</em> is a <b>men problem</b>. Not a "fake" bi, slut-sexual problem. We're just trying to live life right, just like you.</p>
<p>So next time you meet one of these dudes, <b>just set that dude of fire</b> and walk away.</p>

<h3>Labels</h3>
<p>There's a much wider variety of labels available today than when I was a queerling, at around the turn of the millennium. <br>
I didn't give much thought to the difference between bi and pansexual back then, and I didn't know any other options. I questioned my gender identity, but was unaware of nonbinary people (not that they didn't exist, but I didn't find them). I furtively shopped in the men's section, and wore my hair short.<br>
Asexuality and aromanticism were not on my radar either, even though I do think they would have appealed to me strongly at one point in my life. Instead, I identified as a virgin (privately, with just my online friends).<br>
Some say that labels are limits - just a way to box yourself in, and that letting go of labels altogether allows you to embrace all opportunities. Others counter that the right label can help you understand yourself better and find others just like you. "Once I found that I was _____, it all fell into place and I was much less lonely," that sort of thing. That sure sounds swell, but if that's how labels work I guess I still haven't found the right one.<br>
What if everyone around you seems happy with their labels, but you still haven't got a clue? What if you find your label at long last, and then find there are like two other people in the world who identify that way, and no one you talk to has any idea what you're on about?</p>

<div class="hide">
<p>What if you have loudly and proudly embraced a label only to find it no longer fits? To "recant" would prove your haters right, but in the meantime you feel more and more uncomfortable. Sometimes labels <em>are</em> limiting.<br>
For me, as I continued to exist and learn more about myself, my labels shifted.<br>
It turns out I'm not asexual. (Also not a virgin. Also virginity is some patriarchal bullshit, but it was a comfort to me at one time and I don't resent my former self for embracing it. I was going through some shit.)<br>
It turns out my attraction to women is not <em>the same</em> as my attraction to men, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. It feels different. It also feels right.<br>
And although I do not identify as trans, I was right in thinking my gender was a non-straightforward thing.<br>
Labels have their upsides and downsides. Questioning whether you are ________ enough to be _______ is almost certianly a waste of time. Externalising that kind of doubt and running around telling other people they're not ________ enough to be _________ is a waste of time, and also a dick move.<br>
It's good to accept that labels may change, for yourself and for others. Remember always that there are different ways to be ________ and that you have things in common with people outside of your label, too. Hold your labels lightly.

<H3>10 Wonderful Beautiful Amazing stereotypes about Bisexuals, and how they can fix the world for everyone</H3>
<ol>
<li><b>We are ambiguous and fluid, neither one thing nor another.</b> Embracing our fluidity and ambiguity will help break down barriers and black-and-white, us-versus-them thinking. Maybe it would be good for everyone to be just a little less sure about who they are and whom they might love or desire.</li>
<li><b>We are unlikely to be successfully monogamous.</b> You know what? Men, women, gay, straight, nerd, jock, everybody cheats. Embracing the fact that monogamy is difficult sometimes, and that it is only one option among many, will help people find the relationship structure that works best for them. Chilling out even a tiny bit about minor infidelities can save marriages and make all of us more honest.</li>
<li><b>We are sex-crazy sluts who will hump anything that doesn't run away fast enough.</b> Embracing this stereotype will help end slut-shaming, sex-shaming and the ridiculous double standard. It may also get people running, which is good for their health.</li>
<li><b>We are a fad or fashion trend.</b> Yep. We are in fact a fashion trend. I kind of mind-virus, spreading faster than the latest African American slang. Soon, everyone will be bisexual and queer equality will wash across the globe, unstoppable, unhindered, as inescapable as a vapid summer bop. The world will find itself humming bisexually while brushing their teeth, unaware, already infected.</li>
<li><b>We're just having a phase.</b> We might be having a phase, and settle into a different sexuality later in life. This is of course true for everyone. Heterosexuality was a phase for many of us, after all. And anyone might find themselves falling for someone they never expected, at any point in life. Embracing the beauty and truth of our phases will make those moments less traumatic for everyone.</li>

<ol start="6">
<li><b>We are just doing it for the attention.</b> Yes! Oh my goodness, pay attention to us! Bi erasure and bi invisibility are real, and so pervasive, we sometimes forget about ourselves. Let's hear it for attention, for loudness, for in-your-face bi-ness, pan-ness, queer-ness everywhere and anywhere.</li>
<li><b>A bixesual in a relationship with a person who has a gender is just, like, gay or straight now.</b> Invisibility is our curse, but also our superpower. Invisibility allows us to infiltrate monosexual spaces, observe their strange mating habits, report back to bi HQ and further our plans to queer the planet. We are ninja spies, hiding out in ordinary-looing relationships until BAM! It's too late. You're one of us now.</li>
<li><b>Bisexuals are great for threesomes.</b> You know what? We are. But there are good threesomes and shitty threesomes, and I've been in both kinds. If we embrace our special position as unicorns, providors of and experts in threesomes, we're in a position to teach the world a lot about how to have good threeway sex.</li>
<li><b>Bisexuals are, like, dirty. You'll catch something.</b> Talking about STIs is a minefield, yo. Being able to say, <em>so yeah, I'm bi, and these are the ways I take care of my sexual health,</em> can be a positive way to have that conversation, even if it was prejudice that made it happen. All sexually active people take risks. Let's embrace the risks we choose to take. If we are smarter, beter educated and more outspoken about these things than average, we'll make everybody safer and smarter.</li>
<li><b>"Real" bisexuals are super rare, or non-existent. Like unicorns.</b> You ever seen someone pick a fight with a unicorn? Hell no. Rare, beautiful, magical, anyone who sees a bisexual in real life should stop, breathless for a moment, stunned by the blessed sight before them. Maybe genuflect a little. Couldn't hurt.</li>
