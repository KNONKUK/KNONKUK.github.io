<p>Hi everyone, I'm Fox, I have a room in Redland, I'm a student, and I love Bristol and everything it has to offer. I love to dress up and have fun, and although Pride is my favourite protest, I'm also here to stand for democracy and the planet and women's rights and all the other things we need to protest about because we have a cunch of bunts for our governments. *shakes fist*<br><br>

I really love zines and the DIY movement, I love drag, I'm really proud of this little website, and I bloody love KNONK collective! I have two of my zines up on the website so far, they are not in print right now because full colour printing is expensive but you can read them right here! Click on the titles to read the full zine.

     <p>A cute French claymation that looks like a kid's film and is rated PG, but <em>holy crap is it dark</em>. <br>
The DVD case blithely notes that the main character goes to an orphanage after his parents die. It doesn't mention that his mother is a severe alcoholic who threatens to beat him and dies after he acidentally causes her to fall down the stairs. And he is but one of the seven-or-so severely traumatised 8-10 year olds that form the heart of this charming, colourful film. <br>
Is it a French thing?<br>
I'm not against challenging themes in kid's entertainment though, and it treats the kids and their strange behaviours with respect and a gentle hand. The characters are all multi-dimensional, even while made of clay. There's a bully, who turns out not to be all that bad, but also doesn't stop bullying just because they had a good talk. There's a girl with PTSD from unspecified parental abuse, whose mood can be read by how much hair covers up the scar on her face. And a girl who ended up in state care after her mother was deported to an African country, who rushes out the door with a "maman?" whenever a car approaches, but then when her mother does show up, she doesn't go with her.<br>
And, perhaps most surprisingly, we are trusted with these subtle characterisations, trusted to connect the dots and understand what's going on with these kids. Is <em>that</em> a French thing?Because I like it.<br>
Beautiful, slightly haunting.<br><br>

<p>Why do I keep picking up these Japanese books about cats, and books, and slightly magical, quirky characters? I don't think I enjoy them.<br>
This is a book trying to be a Ghibly film where a bookish boy gets whisked away to a magical world of books where he has to verbally spar with people who mistreat books, but... it's not good?<br>
There's a section in the book that makes fun of publishers that just throw out any old rubbish that fits a trend and is easy to read, such that the earth is literally covered with all these cheap, discarded books and I don't mean to be a dick to Mr Natsukawa, but I think this is one of those? <br>
Not for me.</p>

     <h3>What a Drag! Another open mic?</h3>

House of Boussé is a trans-forward drag house and they have an open mic in Café Kino that is strange, wonderful, inscrutable, delightful. It feels a little bit culty but like, in a good way. <br>
Drag can be a funny thing to try to define. The open mic is for any short form performance art by trans+ artists. I’ve seen comedy, music, horror, historical, and genre-defining <em>what-is-its</em> on What a Drag’s small stage and personally, I’m ready for more. </p>
<p>
<b>Last Wednesday</b> of the month, check at:
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatadragbristol/?hl=en">What a Drag! (IG)</a><br>
Café Kino is at: <address>108 Stokes Croft, Bristol BS1 3RU England</address><br>
Accessibility note: the performance is in the basement down some steep steps.
