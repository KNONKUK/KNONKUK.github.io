<em>A bumblebee muses:</em> "Beauty is a point of view. I see different colours, different kinds of beauty. And I'm sure you see things I don't, too. The best thing we can all do is to open up to all kinds of beauty, and we wil start seeing it more and more."<br>

<em>A pink cultivated poppy says:</em> "People tell me I'm beautiful all the time. It's a bit odd to me. I'm actually really self-conscious about how tall I am."<br>
<em>The background shows a woman in the window of a burning building. A fire person climbs a ladder towards her.<br>
A potato speaks out: </em>"It's not always easy to have the best complexion or the best skin. But I have my own stuff going on. I have good texture. Besides, who has time for a facial every day?"<br>
<em>An old delapidated building adds: </em>"Beauty becomes a more delicate, balanced thing as you age. Less effortless. Although, of course, it was never effortless. That was just another illusion."

<h3>Look of the Month</h3>
<p>Our look of the month is an instant classic. These Oyster Mushrooms combine pleasing, predictable texture with sweeping drama and chiaroscuro. Neither animal nor plant, they follow their own rules. A great look for night time gatherings and grand entrances.

<h3>Dear #Beauty!</h3>
<p>Dear #Beauty,<br><br>
So I'm, like, literally a cave troll. Normal make up tips just make me look like a cave troll in lipstick &mdash; ridiculous. <br>
I want to be pretty so bad! Is there anything I can do?<br><br>
xo&mdash;Grendel the Swamp Thing</p>
<p>Dear Grendel,<br><br>
If "pretty" to you is a picture, is a specific way to look, you are all out of luck.<br>
Your face will never look like the digital paintings on the cover of Vogue.<br>
But this perception of "pretty" is incorrect. Pretty is not a picture, pretty is an expression.<br>
Fashion is a language you can use to say how you feel, who you are, how you see yourself, how you hope to be treated, the things you dream of and how you like your coffee &mdash; or your lovers.<br>
Whatever the shape of your canvas, when you paint with the colours of prettiness, your intention will shine through.<br>
And the right people will have the eyes to see it. Don't be afraid. Claim the prettiness that is your birthright.<br><br>x &mdash; Beauty

<h3>Toxic Masculinity</h3>
<p>Get the look!<br><br>
Toxic masculinity is the talk of the town, but there's a lot of misunderstanding around the term. Let our experts set you straight on how to wear it the right way.<br>
"The traits traditionally associated with masculinity are often perfectly good traits for any human to have. Self-sufficiency, emotional mastery, strength, stoic endurance, ambition, courage... None of these traits are toxic in and of themselves, so you'll have to push it to get the desired effect."<br>
<em>Images on this collaged page include a sleazy Aardman character with roses, a chicken the size of a building and a viking hefting an axe.</em>

"Toxicity is all about being anti-social. Go overboard. Take charge when no one needs you to. Display your masculine strength in delicate social situations. Combine your competitive nature with needless aggression to get one up on everyone around you. Go big or go home."</p>
<p>"If we're talking about toxic masculinity, we're talking about violence. Being violent in word and deed is exciting, and you can get away with a lot if you pick your targets appropriately. Read the room. What are the targets of hate for this particular crowd?"<br><br>
<em>Images on this page include a rhinoceros with huge horns, a pirate under a palm tree, a teletubby, a videogame power bar and the muzzle of a machine gun.</em>

"Egalitarians don't like to admit this, but any group of humans has a hierarchy. Every social situation can be a dick-measuring contest if you make it so. You can compete on anything &mdash; knowledge about obscure subjects, number of countries you've travelled to, pints you can drink, creative insults... even your woke-ness and political correctness can be point scoring cards in the universal game of besting everyone."<br>
<em> Images on this page include a male scientist looking at chemistry equipment, a circuit board schematic and riot police.</em>
