<p>Hello Darlings, I'm Deer, and I’m very happy to be part of the KNONK collective (and host for our book club). I love to read, and you can find some of my book reviews below. I also made a zine a number of years ago, and you can read that here (please read the introduction at the top of the page and the content notes.<br><br>

     <p>Pleasant but silly film about middle aged women raising money for charity with a nude calendar. The jokes are mild, the drama is forced, and the whole thing would have been a yawn-fest except for Helen Mirren. I just love her.</p>

I was strongly recommended this and after trying to read it I didn’t want to ask why. <br>   
If I’m going to read a book with this much sadomasochistic sex, I’d like it if anyone was actually enjoying themselves.

One of my top reads of 2025. The story is about a complex family trying to form: a detransitioned trans woman gets his boss pregnant and is asking his ex (a transwoman) to join them and be the second mother to the baby. <br>
Most of the book is actually the character’s back stories, how they got to be who they are and why this crazy premise actually makes a kind of sense, maybe. It’s very queer, it’s funny and sad and hopeful without sanding down the rough edges. <br>
I don’t identify as trans but reading this felt like a window into trans female experiences that an educational text just couldn't ever offer. And I value it deeply for that.

Ooh, #metoo fiction with some nuance and room for interpretation? In <em>this</em> timeline? <br>
This is a novella about a Bad Man that asks: but how bad? Where is the line and when did he cross it? <br>
Reading other reviews I can see they are all over the place. From sympathy for the Bad Man character to full throw-away-the-key condemnation. I think it’s a good book, it’s well written and I feel like I’m better for having read it.
