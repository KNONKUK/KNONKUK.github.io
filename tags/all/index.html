     <p>Pleasant but silly film about middle aged women raising money for charity with a nude calendar. The jokes are mild, the drama is forced, and the whole thing would have been a yawn-fest except for Helen Mirren. I just love her.</p>

I was strongly recommended this and after trying to read it I didn’t want to ask why. <br>   
If I’m going to read a book with this much sadomasochistic sex, I’d like it if anyone was actually enjoying themselves.

One of my top reads of 2025. The story is about a complex family trying to form: a detransitioned trans woman gets his boss pregnant and is asking his ex (a transwoman) to join them and be the second mother to the baby. <br>
Most of the book is actually the character’s back stories, how they got to be who they are and why this crazy premise actually makes a kind of sense, maybe. It’s very queer, it’s funny and sad and hopeful without sanding down the rough edges. <br>
I don’t identify as trans but reading this felt like a window into trans female experiences that an educational text just couldn't ever offer. And I value it deeply for that.

Ooh, #metoo fiction with some nuance and room for interpretation? In <em>this</em> timeline? <br>
This is a novella about a Bad Man that asks: but how bad? Where is the line and when did he cross it? <br>
Reading other reviews I can see they are all over the place. From sympathy for the Bad Man character to full throw-away-the-key condemnation. I think it’s a good book, it’s well written and I feel like I’m better for having read it.

I really love zines and the DIY movement, I love drag, I'm really proud of this little website, and I bloody love KNONK collective!

     <p>A cute French claymation that looks like a kid's film and is rated PG, but <em>holy crap is it dark</em>. <br>
The DVD case blithely notes that the main character goes to an orphanage after his parents die. It doesn't mention that his mother is a severe alcoholic who threatens to beat him and dies after he acidentally causes her to fall down the stairs. And he is but one of the seven-or-so severely traumatised 8-10 year olds that form the heart of this charming, colourful film. <br>
Is it a French thing?<br>
I'm not against challenging themes in kid's entertainment though, and it treats the kids and their strange behaviours with respect and a gentle hand. The characters are all multi-dimensional, even while made of clay. There's a bully, who turns out not to be all that bad, but also doesn't stop bullying just because they had a good talk. There's a girl with PTSD from unspecified parental abuse, whose mood can be read by how much hair covers up the scar on her face. And a girl who ended up in state care after her mother was deported to an African country, who rushes out the door with a "maman?" whenever a car approaches, but then when her mother does show up, she doesn't go with her.<br>
And, perhaps most surprisingly, we are trusted with these subtle characterisations, trusted to connect the dots and understand what's going on with these kids. Is <em>that</em> a French thing?Because I like it.<br>
Beautiful, slightly haunting.<br><br>

<p>Why do I keep picking up these Japanese books about cats, and books, and slightly magical, quirky characters? I don't think I enjoy them.<br>
This is a book trying to be a Ghibly film where a bookish boy gets whisked away to a magical world of books where he has to verbally spar with people who mistreat books, but... it's not good?<br>
There's a section in the book that makes fun of publishers that just throw out any old rubbish that fits a trend and is easy to read, such that the earth is literally covered with all these cheap, discarded books and I don't mean to be a dick to Mr Natsukawa, but I think this is one of those? <br>
Not for me.</p>

House of Boussé is a trans-forward drag house and they have an open mic in Café Kino that is strange, wonderful, inscrutable, delightful. It feels a little bit culty but like, in a good way. <br>
Drag can be a funny thing to try to define. The open mic is for any short form performance art by trans+ artists. I’ve seen comedy, music, horror, historical, and genre-defining <em>what-is-its</em> on What a Drag’s small stage and personally, I’m ready for more. </p>

Café Kino is at: <address>108 Stokes Croft, Bristol BS1 3RU England</address><br>
Accessibility note: the performance is in the basement down some steep steps.

<p>This one was available through <a href="https://www.borrowbox.com/">BorrowBox</a>, which is an e-book library that often has long waiting times for popular books, so you end up reading just whatever looks interesting while you're waiting.<br>
Haverscroft is a haunted house tale about a woman who is recovering from a mental health crisis and is dragged out to the sticks by her unforgivable jerk of a husband to a large country house-and-estate with their two adorable children. He promptly disappears back to the city for work, leaving her and the kids in the obviously haunted house.<br>
A key question in any haunted house tale is this: why don't they just move out? Some variations on the theme handle this better than others. The reason here is, &quot;This house gives me the creeps, but I have to prove to my husband (and his mother) that I'm not crazy anymore, so I'll just close the door to the ghost's room and hope we'll be ok.&quot; That works... up to a point.<br>
The point where it stops working? One night, the chimney which has been producing creepy knocking noises the whole time falls down tearing a massive hole in the roof. Does she leave? No, they put up a tarp.</p>

I’ve been to PRSCs Collage Club twice, and I’ve had a good time twice. They provide boxes of magazines, newspaper, assorted printed stuff and you can do what you want with them. <br>
This time, I made some mini zine pages. I was planning to make a zine about how Instagram is eating your brain and you should leave, but decided against that at the last minute. With no plan whatsoever, I just cut interesting words out of magazine pages for a while, and made ransom note poetry. <br>
It turned into <a href="/pages/choose-horror-and-hysteria">a zine</a> after all. 
The vibe at Cut & Paste collage club is chill, you can talk to people or just do your own thing, and it’s on for long enough to really get stuck in, or to drop in for part of it and do something small.

<p>Exhaustively (exhaustingly) detailed review of a paranormal investigation from interbellum London. Weird book, it draws you in with all these seemingly supernatural happenings, and all the while you're like, &quot;But she's faking, right? This is clearly fake?!&quot; I guess I won't spoil it. It's from a real life report of an actual haunting. <br></p>

   <h1>Movies I watched in 2025</h1>
   <p>At the start of this year, I decided I wanted to change my media consumption: watch some movies, read some books, engage with some significant cultural texts instead of frittering through an endless stream of short video "content".<br>
   My mission was partly successful: I watched 30 movies, which is well over 2 a month, but not close to 1 a week. Some were recent, some very much not. I joined the cinema streamer <a href="https://mubi.com/en/gb">MUBI</a> for a bit and enjoyed what they had to offer, but cancelled after a while because the rent is too damn high. I recommend them though.<br>
   Here is my personal awards list for the movies I saw this year. 
</p>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<h1>Best film nominees:</h1>
  <h2>(they all win)</h2>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/thelastshowgirl.png" alt="Altered still from The Last Showgirl" class="rounded"/>
<h2>The Last Showgirl</h2>
<p>The Last Showgirl holds two contradictory views at the same time, and invites us <strong>not</strong> to judge.</p> 
<p>It’s very good. It’s Pamela Anderson (!) playing a Vegas Showgirl who has sacrificed her relationship with her daughter, and to some degree, her whole life, to be a dancer in this traditional Vegas Showgirl show. It felt like a bit of a double feature with The Substance, which is much angrier, but is also about an aging female star chewed up and spat out by show business. The Substance has a lot of rage about the cruelty of that, and that’s valid. The Last Showgirl has something more fragile and poignant to say.  </p>
<p>Her daughter at one point calls it a “stupid nudie show”, but to Anderson’s character it’s much more than that. Others may think the show is a tawdry thing, the outdated leftovers of another era. But to her, it’s a show with history, it’s something sophisticated and French. Being on stage makes her feel beautiful and that’s important to her, even if she also doubts herself and her life choices at times.</p>
<p>The film manages to hold both points of view: it is both a stupid nudie show <em>and</em> a thing of beauty and power.</p>
<p>And what it said to me, personally, is that whatever your thing is that’s so important to you now may turn out to be a stupid nudie show, or it may turn out to be the Real Thing, and it’s probably both and all you can do is try your best. </p>
<p>It’s a very moving film and I love it.</p> 
<span>Winner, despite <i>fierce</i> competition: Older actress comeback of the year</span> 
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/babygirl.png" alt=""  class="rounded"/>
<h2>Babygirl</h2>
<p>I've seen some mixed reviews for this one but they're all wrong: this is a flawless piece. Amazing work by Nicole Kidman.</p>
<p>The first time we see the intern outside of his office gear, in the hotel room in his white T-shirt and standard issue bro chain, I was like, <em>girl, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Antonio is a reasonable man, he'll understand...</em></p>
<span>Winner: Panty-dropper of the year</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/iwatchedthetvglow.png" alt="" class="rounded" class="rounded" />
<h2>I Watched the TV Glow</h2>
<p>A recommendation handed down to us by a trans-masc drag queen from the stage, this was a quiet gem of a movie.</p>
<p>It's about how much you loved and lived for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and also how you're living the wrong fucking life but it's not too late. There is still time.</p>
<span>Winner: Best mental breakdown</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/holdovers.png" alt="" class="rounded" />
<h2>The Holdovers</h2>
<p>Watched this during the interfestum, just before the end of the year. It's a wonderful, quiet piece about three troubled souls left over in their boarding school during the Christmas period.</p>
<p>It feels really old-school, nothing wild happens, it's just these characters and their normal/remarkable situations. Mary's quiet dignity in the face of grief was beautiful, and made me cry. </p>
<span>Winner: Most touching</span> 
</article>
<header class="content-box">
<h1>Other highlights:</h1>
</header>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/thesubstance.png" alt="Altered still from The Substance" class="rounded" />
<h2>The Substance</h2>
<p>Absolute madness, love and rage. Demi Moore is SO SEXY. Enjoyed it a lot.</p> 
<span>Winner: Bloodiest</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/holymotors.png" alt="" class="rounded" class="rounded" />
<h2>Holy Motors</h2>
<p>This is a really weird one, it's French. The main character is and actor working out of a limousine. He transforms himself into different characters with make up, prosthetics, costumes and wigs, and gets out of the car to play his character in (what looks like) real life. So we get a series of emotionally intense scenes, some funny, some violent, some strange or scary, with the only connection being the actor.</p>
<p>The film doesn’t explain what the heck is going on, who this man is, how he came to do this work or what any of it means. It’s not about figuring out the mystery, it’s about going along for the ride. I had the feeling at one point that this is a kind of afterlife for our main character, but that doesn't seem to be a common take. Maybe it’s about acting, maybe it’s about identity. I don’t know, and I don’t need to know. It was funny and wild and dark and very compelling. I don’t regret a single minute I spent watching it, thinking about it, and trying to explain it to my partner. Hard recommend.</p>
<p>The actor playing all the different characters is played by Denis Lavant. Don’t think I’ve seen him before but he’s fantastic. And if you’re of a sensitive bent, you’ll want this teeny tiny spoiler: Eva Mendez (the model) is OK. She doesn’t get hurt, don’t worry. Also Kylie Minogue is in it. IKR?!</p>
<p>My favourite part was this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qxG3LzYkfg" target="_blank">musical intermezzo</a>. You won’t need the context for this, because there isn’t any. Just enjoy it.</p>
<span>Winner: most surreal</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<h2>Paris is Burning</h2>
<p>Remarkable that this exists at all. Heartbreaking. Funny. Fabulous. If you haven't seen it, seek it out. And if you are part of a bunch of people doing something unusual that really matters to them and that nobody else understands: maybe make a documentary about it. You never know.</p>
<span>Winner: historical artefact of the year</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/sinners.png" alt="" class="rounded" />
<h2>Sinners</h2>
<p>OMG, film of the year, am I right? I don't really follow the awards much but I'm going to assume that this wins/won big. Favourite bit: the old man in the car talking about how he lost his friend, and then singing to keep from crying.</p>
<span>Winner: Best Soundtrack</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<img src="/images/tangerine.jpg" alt="" class="rounded" />
<h2>Tangerine</h2>
<p>Found this on Mubi: two trans sex workers set out to have a word with the cheating bastard boyfriend of one of them. The insane, marriage wrecking, druggy chaos that follows is bracing, but their friendship is a sad and beautiful anchor.</p>
<span>Winner: Low-budget Knock-out</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
<h2>Metropolis</h2>
<img src="/images/metropolis.jpg" alt="" class="rounded" />
<p>Absolutely horrifying scenes in the flooding lower city aside, this was pretty cool. Let's all agree it's not remembered for the story, which was incoherent, and enjoy the iconic costumes and visuals.</p>
<span>Winner: Most Actingest Acting</span>
</article>
<header class="content-box">
  <h1>Horror Section</h1>
 <p> I had this notion that it would be cool to revisit some of the classic horror movies I wasn't allowed to watch or that scared my pants off when I was young: slasher stuff from late 1980s - 1990s. We didn't get very far, but I watched quite a few horrors nonetheless. </p>
</header>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>Nosferatu</h2>
  <p>Fantastic. Loved the atmospheric shots, the shadow play, the sexual subtext (does it count as sub-?). I did have a moment, when he fist approached the tomb, of wondering if I could really be expected to take this seriously post What We Do in the Shadows, but I got over myself and enjoyed it.</p> 
  <p>"I am nothing but an appetite."</p>
  <span>Winner: spookiest</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>The VVitch</h2>
  <p>Also great. I was solidly on the Eggers train until we watched The Lighthouse. Love the period-accurate language, the use of colour, everything involving Anya Taylor-Joy.</p> 
  <span>Winner: most historically accurate</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>Frankenstein</h2>
  <p>Fun, lovely costumes and set design, interesting sort-of-twist for the ending. Ultimately a very familiar story, luckily both Frankenstein and the creature were mighty tasty.</p> 
<p><span>Winner: best production design</span></p>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>Child's Play</h2>
  <p>Our foray into the classic slasher genre kind of began and ended here, because we didn't really enjoy it. Child's Play scared me s-less when I first saw it, now it was mostly kind of a annoying. Chucky is <b>not</b> a formidable opponent. I vividly remembered the scene where mom finds out there's no batteries in the doll, but it barely rased my pulse in 2025. Funny how we change. It features cute rats though, and regains a point for that. </p> 
<p><span>Winner: silliest</span></p>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>Weapons</h2>
  <p>I dunno I liked it I guess but I felt like we finished a completely different movie than we started. Not complaining because the tension in the first act was actually a bit much for me and it relaxed a bit after the reveal. Loved the different character perspectives.</p> 
<p><span>Winner: best twist</span></p>
</article>
<header class="content-box">
  <h1>Hate section</h1>
  <p>Some I didn't enjoy.</p>
</header>
<article class="content-box">
<h2>The Lighthouse</h2>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>A friend of mine really loved it, and I respect that, but ew. Apptly Pattinson said it was "100% a comedy" and I can kind of see that? There are some very funny bits, but the oppressive atmosphere and violence and drinking/self-poisoning of it all just made it so I barely dared to laugh at it. </p>
<p>This bit made me giggle in the shower the next morning though: "Fine, have it your way. I like your cooking!"</p>
<span>Winner: Most shit-faced. No, literally.</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>Cats</h2>
  <p>The creepy cg one, yes. OK, so this was a hate-watch basically, we watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3aK-EK5V2k" target="_blank">cool video essay</a> on why this film fails from a musical perspective, and we wanted to see it in all its horrible glory.</p> 
  <p>And yes, truly amazing. Why? Why did you make that?</p>
  <span>Winner: worst musical/comedy</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>Queer</h2>
  <p>Didn't expect to hate this one. It's well made, good lead actor, and the subject matter is relevant to my interests, at least at first blush. But I turned it off midway.</p>
  <p>Turns out that no, I would not like to watch Daniel Craig lounging around Mexico City, drinking, smoking and being miserable. Maybe I should have given it longer. The trailer made it look really good. The trailer makes me want to give it another shot, to be honest. But yea, I turned it off.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
  <span>Winner: booziest</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>Interstellar</h2>
  <p>Oh boy. I've got some notes on this one.</p>
  <p>I think I may have put it on by accident, mistaking it for a completely different deep space movie. Man, this made me ranty. The world-building is sketchy: it's the future, and it's an agrarian society where "everyone" is a farmer, but the farms are huge monoculture megafarms with corn supposedly suffering from drought and blight even though they look green as hell. Who is eating all that corn if everybody is farmers?</p>
  <p>This is worse when we come back 20 years later and the monoculture megafarms are still supposedly failing, with the same crop looking just as green. Hey, guys? If blight is a big issue for the crop you're growing, do you think it might help to grow <em>more than one crop?!</em></p>
  <p>And, yeah, the space stuff doesn't make any sense either, evil Matt Damon didn't convince, the emotional notes sound flat... ugh.</p>
<p><span>Winner: worst science</span></p>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>The Fountain</h2>
  <p>We watched this in a small cinema for our friend's birthday. It's another sci-fi one about a man obsessed with curing death. He's on a dealine because his wife is dying. The enjoyment we got from this was afterwards, as we picked holes in the plot together and yelled at Wolverine, who was too busy trying to <em>defeat death</em> to spend time with his wife.</p> 
  <p><em>She's DYING! All she wants is ten minutes of your time! BE with her you absolute FAILURE of a MAN!</em></p>
  <p>Cool visuals though.</p>
  <span>Winner: most disappointing main character</span>
</article>
<article class="content-box">
  <h2>The Hypnosis</h2>
  <p>Found this through Mubi. It's a European film about a couple who are trying to pitch their start-up but she has been released from her need to conform to social norms by a hypnosis session. More cringe than comedy. I feel like I didn't get it. </p>
  <span>Winner: most cringe</span>
</article>
<header class="content-box">
  <h1>Also:</h1>
</header>
<article class="content-box">
<h2>After Yang</h2>
<p>Haunting piece about memory, identity, and AI companions.</p>
<h2>Elvis</h2>
<p>Dragged Elvis up from laughable cliché into the sex symbol he really was. Gorgeous. Fun.</p>
<h2>Reality+</h2>
<p>Short from the maker of The Substance, covering some of the same themes. A little less gory.</p>
<h2>Lucky Grandma</h2>
<p>Hilarious, loved this so much. A grandmother wins and loses big at the casino, and gets in trouble with local gangs. Another remarkable performance by an experienced actress, they just kept on coming this year.</p>
<h2>Her</h2>
<p>Romance between man and AI assistant. Sweet and strange.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Being Earnest</h2>
<P>We saw an adaptation with Dame Judi Dench out of frustration that we missed the stage performance with Ncuti Gatwa. Entertaining enough but could have done with more Ncuti.</P>
<h2>La la land</h2>
<p>Eh.</p>
<h2>Poor Things</h2>
<p>Yeeeeeees!</p>
<h2>Wallace and Gromit: Vengence most Fowl</h2>
<p>Local heroes Wallace and Gromit do it again. Funny jokes, silly slapstick, and even tied into the theme of the year: AI. I loved the canal boat chase especially.</p>
<h2>Mickey 17</h2>
<p>Loved this too, made me want to watch more of Robert Pattinson's forays into the weird and wonderful. And then we saw The Lighthouse and went: that's enough Robert Pattinson now!</p>

<h3>Dear #Beauty!</h3>
<p>Dear #Beauty,<br><br>
So I'm, like, literally a cave troll. Normal make up tips just make me look like a cave troll in lipstick &mdash; ridiculous. <br>
I want to be pretty so bad! Is there anything I can do?<br><br>
xo&mdash;Grendel the Swamp Thing</p>
<p>Dear Grendel,<br><br>
If "pretty" to you is a picture, is a specific way to look, you are all out of luck.<br>
Your face will never look like the digital paintings on the cover of Vogue.<br>
But this perception of "pretty" is incorrect. Pretty is not a picture, pretty is an expression.<br>
Fashion is a language you can use to say how you feel, who you are, how you see yourself, how you hope to be treated, the things you dream of and how you like your coffee &mdash; or your lovers.<br>
Whatever the shape of your canvas, when you paint with the colours of prettiness, your intention will shine through.<br>
And the right people will have the eyes to see it. Don't be afraid. Claim the prettiness that is your birthright.<br><br>x &mdash; Beauty

<h3>Toxic Masculinity</h3>
<p>Get the look!<br><br>
Toxic masculinity is the talk of the town, but there's a lot of misunderstanding around the term. Let our experts set you straight on how to wear it the right way.<br>
"The traits traditionally associated with masculinity are often perfectly good traits for any human to have. Self-sufficiency, emotional mastery, strength, stoic endurance, ambition, courage... None of these traits are toxic in and of themselves, so you'll have to push it to get the desired effect."<br>

"Toxicity is all about being anti-social. Go overboard. Take charge when no one needs you to. Display your masculine strength in delicate social situations. Combine your competitive nature with needless aggression to get one up on everyone around you. Go big or go home."</p>
<p>"If we're talking about toxic masculinity, we're talking about violence. Being violent in word and deed is exciting, and you can get away with a lot if you pick your targets appropriately. Read the room. What are the targets of hate for this particular crowd?"<br><br>

<p>
   This is a zine about surviving sexual violence. We often talk a lot about the immediate trauma and not so much about how, with the years, it can be something that stays with you without defining you. It’s part of our histories for so many of us, and it remains difficult to talk about. So although I wrote this in 2018 and I don’t fully agree with everything I said in it, I humbly offer it, unedited, in its entirety in the hopes it is of use.

<h3>Girls</h3>
<p>You may have heard the news; the bis aren't doing so well. </p>
<ul><li>We have more mood disorders such as depression, as well as anxiety disorders.</li>
<li>We have higher rates of hypertension, poor health, smoking and risky drinking.</li>
<li>We are far more likely to feel suicidal than heterosexuals, gay men, and lesbian women.</li>
<li>We're less likely to be out, and more likely to experience discrimination from our friends.</li></ul>
<p>
So that sucks, and that's enough reason to spill some ink on the subject, I suppose. But the real drive behind the zine you're holding wasn't dry stats, but rage, because of course. I got angry about the backlash to [a] pop song by Rita Ora (not an artist I previously had an opinion on) because that song spoke to something in me. And it got apnned as homophobic, biphobic and harmful to the LGBT+ community.<br>
Rita Ora and friends rap and sing about being "50/50" and not hiding it, kush loving, drinking wine and kissing girls. The lyrics were described as "obviously problematic". Lesbian pop star Hayley Kiyoko said: <br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [...] Every so often there come certain songs with messaging that is just downright tone-deaf, which does more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community. A song like this just fuels the male gaze while marginalizing the idea of women loving women. [...] I don't need to drink wine to kiss girls; I've loved women my entire life. This type of message is dangerous because it completely belittles and invalidates the very pure feelings of an entire community.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Internet comments on the lyrics were even more scathing. </p>
<blockquote><p>
  What are you talking about? An Anthem for bisexuality?! This song is only about sexualizing women, that has nothing to do with love and sexual orientation. The lyrics are disgusting, but I'm not surprised. They come from people who see themselves only as nothing more than a body. It's ashaming that women see other women this way. "A kitten"?! What is wrong with you people?! This is just like a sexist man sees a girl like a sexual toy. A girl is more than that. This song makes me sick. <br>
  <em>54 upvotes</em>
</p></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><p>On behalf of my fellow bisexuals, I'm rejecting this as our "anthem".
</p></blockquote>
<p>Editor's note: you can still read all about this 8 year old controversy by searching for the lyrics to <a href="https://genius.com/Rita-ora-girls-lyrics" target="_blank">Rita Ora - Girls</a>. </p>

<blockquote><p>Great more poeple sexualising bisexuality.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This song is trash.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I hope I speak for everyone when I say this song is not a real bisexual anthem. I'm bi and this really annoys me. Stop turning an orientation into a fetish. We're real people
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, Rita Ora, who clarified the song reflects her own experiences with women, is not a real person. And her feelings don't count as "very pure". And singing a song about partying, hooking up and sex - that's most songs in this genre - is "disgusting" and has nothing to do with love and sexual orientation.<br>
It seems that for a bisexual woman, it's not enough to come out by recording a hit song about the same things other pop starts sing about, you have to be pure, make sure you don't sexualise yourself, and that you don't "feed the male gaze" (it's a ravenous beast, you guys). It's not good enough to just be out there, visible and honest about your love of wine, kush and loving ladies.<br>
You see, if you want to be out and bi, you have to make sure you're a <em>good</em> bisexual: monogamous, relationship oriented, with pure and good feelings, not disgusting sexy ones, and be secure in your identity without phasing and wavering and also be clean and sober and don't ever cheat or fuck up. Basically, be perfect. <br>
Because otherwise you're just feeding the "negative" stereotypes of bisexuals, and that means it's also <em>your</em> fault that society doesn't have time for bisexuals.<br>
The noise about <em>Girls</em> has come and gone as I write this, and I may be the only one still upset about it. But it made me think, and write, a bunch of stuff that turned into this zine.<br>
Bi websites and organisations are often very concerned with stereotypes, so concerned that they risk alienating the many bisexuals who happen to meet (some of) those stereotypes. In this zine, I'm dreaming of a better way, where we embrace our stereotypes and the people that represent them, instead of hiding the freaks at the back.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<h3>A definition</h3>
<p>A lot of people seem to think of bisexuality as being "in between" het- and homosexuality. Hence "OK, but do you lean more this way or the other?"</p>
<P>I prefer to think of it as <em>both</em>. Both hetero and homo, perhaps at different times, perhaps in different ways, but the <em>potential</em> is there, always.</p>
<p>And that means that, much like a gay person who is single and not looking is still gay, a bi person in a relationship with someone of a gender is still bi.</p>

<h3>Phase</h3>
<p>Many sites and pamphlets on the pleasures and discontents of bisexuality list "it's a phase" as one of the harmful myths and stereotypes people have about bisexuality.<br>
It supports bi erasure and the denial of bisexuality as a "valid" sexual orientation, because it allows biphobes to dismiss any real life evidence of bisexuals existing in the world by saying - oh, you'll grow out of it.<br>
On the other hand, for some people, bisexuality <em>is</em> a phase. Or was a phase for them, when they were figuring themselves out. Awkward, but true.<br>
For some folks, sexuality is clear cut - they know who they are and what they want and it doesn't change or confuse them. For many of us, it's not that simple, and we may try on a few different labels before settling, or continue to reinvent ourselves throughout our lives.<br>
There's nothing wrong with that. This isn't a problem.<br>
The problem is not so much that bisexuality is a phase (for some) but that people use this to dismiss us, deny the importance of our experience and refuse to take us seriously.<br>
Just because something is temporary doesn't mean it's not important. Brad Pitt's marriages are just a phase, we took them seriously enough, as a culture.

<blockquote><p>I was strongly attracted to gay men, but smart enough to realise that was not gonna work. Androgyny excited me, in men as well as women. In the late nineties, I didn't have the vocabulary to describe what I was, or what I was after, but I figured the local gay/lesbian scene probably had something to offer.</p>
<p>I was shy though. It may have been my third time in a bar of any kind, ever. I spoke to a guy who told me how great the place was on the weekend, when it was heaving with people, which sounded like hell. I let a girl buy me a drink, but the conversation was awkward and I didn't know how I felt about her. I felt like a fake. I got scared and went home.</P></blockquote>

<h3>Don't you just hate it when girls make out just to get attention from guys?</h3>
<p>No actually.</p>
<p>I like doing that. It's hot to be watched. It's hot to know a watcher is getting hot watching you get hot because they're watching. It's a hotness loop!</P>
<p>Sure, this is the only bisexuality that gets any media airtime, and <em>that's</em> a problem, but let's take a moment to remember bi women <em>aren't the reason for that problem.</em> That's not our fault.</p>
<p>And let's remember that if some douchebro gets overexcited when you say you're bi, or gives you a creepy "ooh, can I watch" vibe when you're just trying to have a drink with your girlfriend, that douche is being a douche.</p>
<p>Men being over-entitled and thinking female queer sexuality is all about <em>them</em> is a <b>men problem</b>. Not a "fake" bi, slut-sexual problem. We're just trying to live life right, just like you.</p>
<p>So next time you meet one of these dudes, <b>just set that dude of fire</b> and walk away.</p>

<h3>Labels</h3>
<p>There's a much wider variety of labels available today than when I was a queerling, at around the turn of the millennium. <br>
I didn't give much thought to the difference between bi and pansexual back then, and I didn't know any other options. I questioned my gender identity, but was unaware of nonbinary people (not that they didn't exist, but I didn't find them). I furtively shopped in the men's section, and wore my hair short.<br>
Asexuality and aromanticism were not on my radar either, even though I do think they would have appealed to me strongly at one point in my life. Instead, I identified as a virgin (privately, with just my online friends).<br>
Some say that labels are limits - just a way to box yourself in, and that letting go of labels altogether allows you to embrace all opportunities. Others counter that the right label can help you understand yourself better and find others just like you. "Once I found that I was _____, it all fell into place and I was much less lonely," that sort of thing. That sure sounds swell, but if that's how labels work I guess I still haven't found the right one.<br>
What if everyone around you seems happy with their labels, but you still haven't got a clue? What if you find your label at long last, and then find there are like two other people in the world who identify that way, and no one you talk to has any idea what you're on about?</p>

<div class="hide">
<p>What if you have loudly and proudly embraced a label only to find it no longer fits? To "recant" would prove your haters right, but in the meantime you feel more and more uncomfortable. Sometimes labels <em>are</em> limiting.<br>
For me, as I continued to exist and learn more about myself, my labels shifted.<br>
It turns out I'm not asexual. (Also not a virgin. Also virginity is some patriarchal bullshit, but it was a comfort to me at one time and I don't resent my former self for embracing it. I was going through some shit.)<br>
It turns out my attraction to women is not <em>the same</em> as my attraction to men, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. It feels different. It also feels right.<br>
And although I do not identify as trans, I was right in thinking my gender was a non-straightforward thing.<br>
Labels have their upsides and downsides. Questioning whether you are ________ enough to be _______ is almost certianly a waste of time. Externalising that kind of doubt and running around telling other people they're not ________ enough to be _________ is a waste of time, and also a dick move.<br>
It's good to accept that labels may change, for yourself and for others. Remember always that there are different ways to be ________ and that you have things in common with people outside of your label, too. Hold your labels lightly.

<H3>10 Wonderful Beautiful Amazing stereotypes about Bisexuals, and how they can fix the world for everyone</H3>
<ol>
<li><b>We are ambiguous and fluid, neither one thing nor another.</b> Embracing our fluidity and ambiguity will help break down barriers and black-and-white, us-versus-them thinking. Maybe it would be good for everyone to be just a little less sure about who they are and whom they might love or desire.</li>
<li><b>We are unlikely to be successfully monogamous.</b> You know what? Men, women, gay, straight, nerd, jock, everybody cheats. Embracing the fact that monogamy is difficult sometimes, and that it is only one option among many, will help people find the relationship structure that works best for them. Chilling out even a tiny bit about minor infidelities can save marriages and make all of us more honest.</li>
<li><b>We are sex-crazy sluts who will hump anything that doesn't run away fast enough.</b> Embracing this stereotype will help end slut-shaming, sex-shaming and the ridiculous double standard. It may also get people running, which is good for their health.</li>
<li><b>We are a fad or fashion trend.</b> Yep. We are in fact a fashion trend. I kind of mind-virus, spreading faster than the latest African American slang. Soon, everyone will be bisexual and queer equality will wash across the globe, unstoppable, unhindered, as inescapable as a vapid summer bop. The world will find itself humming bisexually while brushing their teeth, unaware, already infected.</li>
<li><b>We're just having a phase.</b> We might be having a phase, and settle into a different sexuality later in life. This is of course true for everyone. Heterosexuality was a phase for many of us, after all. And anyone might find themselves falling for someone they never expected, at any point in life. Embracing the beauty and truth of our phases will make those moments less traumatic for everyone.</li>

<ol start="6">
<li><b>We are just doing it for the attention.</b> Yes! Oh my goodness, pay attention to us! Bi erasure and bi invisibility are real, and so pervasive, we sometimes forget about ourselves. Let's hear it for attention, for loudness, for in-your-face bi-ness, pan-ness, queer-ness everywhere and anywhere.</li>
<li><b>A bixesual in a relationship with a person who has a gender is just, like, gay or straight now.</b> Invisibility is our curse, but also our superpower. Invisibility allows us to infiltrate monosexual spaces, observe their strange mating habits, report back to bi HQ and further our plans to queer the planet. We are ninja spies, hiding out in ordinary-looing relationships until BAM! It's too late. You're one of us now.</li>
<li><b>Bisexuals are great for threesomes.</b> You know what? We are. But there are good threesomes and shitty threesomes, and I've been in both kinds. If we embrace our special position as unicorns, providors of and experts in threesomes, we're in a position to teach the world a lot about how to have good threeway sex.</li>
<li><b>Bisexuals are, like, dirty. You'll catch something.</b> Talking about STIs is a minefield, yo. Being able to say, <em>so yeah, I'm bi, and these are the ways I take care of my sexual health,</em> can be a positive way to have that conversation, even if it was prejudice that made it happen. All sexually active people take risks. Let's embrace the risks we choose to take. If we are smarter, beter educated and more outspoken about these things than average, we'll make everybody safer and smarter.</li>
<li><b>"Real" bisexuals are super rare, or non-existent. Like unicorns.</b> You ever seen someone pick a fight with a unicorn? Hell no. Rare, beautiful, magical, anyone who sees a bisexual in real life should stop, breathless for a moment, stunned by the blessed sight before them. Maybe genuflect a little. Couldn't hurt.</li>

<p>Hey, I'm the Goat. I live in Clifton, and I've been on the streets demonstrating since the days of Act Up, when I was just an angry kid. <br><br>
I'm a bit older now and I have a nice house, but that doesn't mean I'm no longer angry. You know, it's really striking to me how the current "debate" about trans people is really just a copy-paste job of all the same lies they used to tell about us homosexuals. They've swapped some of the terms around but when you scratch the surface, it's just "Save the Children" all over again, as if you'll stop kids from turning out queer (whether that's trans or gay) by not talking about it.<br><br>
I'm very disappointed that so many of my "respectable" neighbours are falling for the same tricks again, and beyond angry that our government has brought back Section 28 for trans people. <br><br>
I just want to say, if you're trans and this shit is getting to you, please hang in there. The tide will turn, the bastards will not get us down. You are part of this movement and you better believe that I'm going to fight for your rights, just like people like you have always stood up for mine. 
<br><br>
But anyway, that's enough of me being a grumpy old man. I haven't got any zines or anything, but the younguns asked me to contribute some film and book reviews, so you can find those here.<br>
I'll see you on the streets!

     <h3>Murder Most Fab</h3>
     <h4>Julian Clarey</h4>
     <p>20 Jan 2026</p>

     </div>


     <p><em>finished <time datetime="2026-01-20">20 Jan 2026</time></em></p>
<p>
Delightful, camp murder comedy about a young man on his way to super stardom who just keeps getting put into situations where he unfortunately has to murder other men. Woe is he.<br>
The character is a lot more sympathetic than I would have guessed from the premise, he's more of a lovable idiot than a magnificent bastard. It's sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, but the story is saved from nihilism by the character's enduring love for a YA summer romance. <br>
Best read of the year so far. (Yes, it's mid January, but still.) <br>

Fun watch! Some cool songs, mood-elevating dance scenes, and some real stars in “what are you doing here?” parts, who actually pull it all together.<br>
We have Christopher Walken as a joke-shop owner dad, Michelle Pfeiffer as the evil (former beauty) queen and, yeah, <em>John Travolta in drag?</em><br>
If you search for “Travolta Hairspray” google suggests asking <em>why’d he do it?</em> And I guess that was sort of my question. He’s a weird pick, for sure. And it’s for sure a brave move for him. But the really surprising bit is that he kinda knocks it out of the park!? Kinda!? <br>
My favourite scene was her and Christopher Walken singing about how much they love each other even though they’re a pair of old farts. Actually touching, but then I’m an old fart. <br>
The Guardian had a two star review, proving once and for all they’re a bunch of fuddy-duddies who hate fun.

I was new to Chuck Tingle, who also has a very sexy fiction podcast where his erotic stories are read by the people of Welcome to Nightvale (get that where-ever you get your podcasts). He’s good. I liked it. Blazed through it on a roadtrip.<br>
Bury your Gays is a very enjoyable, madcap Hollywood horror about the future of entertainment in the age of AI, being out, artistic integrity and the ghosts of the past. Well plotted, great cast, satisfying ending. No notes.

     <p>A cute French claymation that looks like a kid's film and is rated PG, but <em>holy crap is it dark</em>. <br>
The DVD case blithely notes that the main character goes to an orphanage after his parents die. It doesn't mention that his mother is a severe alcoholic who threatens to beat him and dies after he acidentally causes her to fall down the stairs. And he is but one of the seven-or-so severely traumatised 8-10 year olds that form the heart of this charming, colourful film. <br>
Is it a French thing?<br>
I'm not against challenging themes in kid's entertainment though, and it treats the kids and their strange behaviours with respect and a gentle hand. The characters are all multi-dimensional, even while made of clay. There's a bully, who turns out not to be all that bad, but also doesn't stop bullying just because they had a good talk. There's a girl with PTSD from unspecified parental abuse, whose mood can be read by how much hair covers up the scar on her face. And a girl who ended up in state care after her mother was deported to an African country, who rushes out the door with a "maman?" whenever a car approaches, but then when her mother does show up, she doesn't go with her.<br>
And, perhaps most surprisingly, we are trusted with these subtle characterisations, trusted to connect the dots and understand what's going on with these kids. Is <em>that</em> a French thing?Because I like it.<br>
Beautiful, slightly haunting.<br><br>

     <p>Pleasant but silly film about middle aged women raising money for charity with a nude calendar. The jokes are mild, the drama is forced, and the whole thing would have been a yawn-fest except for Helen Mirren. I just love her.</p>

     <h3>About Schmidt</h3>
     <h4>2002</h4>
     <p>25 Jan 2026</p>
     </div>
     </div>

     

     <p>Boomer retires, loses wife, starts to unravel. With Jack Nickolson. Honestly, I was worried I would not like this one. An old white guy, comfortably middle class, can’t take care of himself, can’t stop himself from insulting and disappointing those around him. It’s tough to make a guy like that likeable.<br>
So why does it work?<br>
<img src="/images/aboutschmidt.jpg" clear=both><br></p>
<p>I read some writing advice once to the effect that your characters don’t have to be good at what they’re doing, but they have to give it what they got. A businessman trying to survive a plane crash in the desert even though he has 0 wilderness experience? Compelling. A teenager who can’t get out of a tight spot because, oops, she left her phone at home? Unacceptable!<br>
We understand the kind of man Schmidt is from the first few scenes. He works a boring corporate job, his wife has looked after him since he left home, he represses his emotions in the name of rationality. Yes, he messes everything up, but it’s because he really doesn’t have the basic life skills to keep his house tidy or feed himself, and he doesn’t have the emotional management and communication skills to navigate the conflicts he gets into. He’s never had to learn that stuff, but <em>he is giving it the best he’s got.</em><br>
And if that means loading up a supermarket trolley with frozen pizzas because that’s the only thing he knows how to cook, then he will do that with gusto. If the only way he can express his feelings about his future son-in-law is through explaining his dream about aliens, he’s going to give <em>that</em> his best shot.<br>
And I think that’s why we forgive him, even when he messes things up again and again. His character would normally be the obstacle in someone else’s story. He’s a side character turned main character, and somehow it works. <br>
The box was all about how funny it is, and it is, but the humour arises out of the absurdity, with occasional splashes of slapstick. The pace is slow. The frustration high. We both enjoyed it.<br><br></p>

<p>
Fun watch! Some cool songs, mood-elevating dance scenes, and some real stars in “what are you doing here?” parts, who actually pull it all together.<br>
We have Christopher Walken as a joke-shop owner dad, Michelle Pfeiffer as the evil (former beauty) queen and, yeah, <em>John Travolta in drag?</em><br>
If you search for “Travolta Hairspray” google suggests asking <em>why’d he do it?</em> And I guess that was sort of my question. He’s a weird pick, for sure. And it’s for sure a brave move for him. But the really surprising bit is that he kinda knocks it out of the park!? Kinda!? <br>
My favourite scene was her and Christopher Walken singing about how much they love each other even though they’re a pair of old farts. Actually touching, but then I’m an old fart. <br>
The Guardian had a two star review, proving once and for all they’re a bunch of fuddy-duddies who hate fun.

Toxic masculinity, the movie. Our hero is hanging out with a bunch of war criminals when Bjork reminds him he's supposed to avenge his father.<br>
He does, by sneaking around the hall killing men at night, like a ghost. This is the kind of stuff that made Grendel the bad guy, but I think we're still supposed to root for him?<br>
No "be or not to be" for this guy, he's here for his vengeance and he'll do anything to get it. What a waste. The witchy stuff was cool, the gore and violence got a bit much.<br> 
Not for me.

     <h3>The Cat who saved Books</h3>

     <p><em>finished 
<time datetime="2026-02-01">

</em></p>
<p>Why do I keep picking up these Japanese books about cats, and books, and slightly magical, quirky characters? I don't think I enjoy them.<br>
This is a book trying to be a Ghibly film where a bookish boy gets whisked away to a magical world of books where he has to verbally spar with people who mistreat books, but... it's not good?<br>
There's a section in the book that makes fun of publishers that just throw out any old rubbish that fits a trend and is easy to read, such that the earth is literally covered with all these cheap, discarded books and I don't mean to be a dick to Mr Natsukawa, but I think this is one of those? <br>
Not for me.</p>

     <h3>Haverscroft</h3>
     <h4>S A Harris</h4>

<p>This one was available through <a href="https://www.borrowbox.com/">BorrowBox</a>, which is an e-book library that often has long waiting times for popular books, so you end up reading just whatever looks interesting while you're waiting.<br>
Haverscroft is a haunted house tale about a woman who is recovering from a mental health crisis and is dragged out to the sticks by her unforgivable jerk of a husband to a large country house-and-estate with their two adorable children. He promptly disappears back to the city for work, leaving her and the kids in the obviously haunted house.<br>
A key question in any haunted house tale is this: why don't they just move out? Some variations on the theme handle this better than others. The reason here is, &quot;This house gives me the creeps, but I have to prove to my husband (and his mother) that I'm not crazy anymore, so I'll just close the door to the ghost's room and hope we'll be ok.&quot; That works... up to a point.<br>
The point where it stops working? One night, the chimney which has been producing creepy knocking noises the whole time falls down tearing a massive hole in the roof. Does she leave? No, they put up a tarp.</p>
<blockquote><b>Hey, crazy lady! You have a perfectly rational reason here to leave the house for literally anywhere else. You cannot heat the place. God knows when the next bit of roof is going to collapse in. Your children aren't safe. Tell your asshole husband <em>he</em> is crazy if he expects you to stay in that rickety, depressing old deathtrap. Why are you there?</b>
<h2><em>LEAVE!</em></h2></blockquote>
Everything after that is a bunch of nonsense I didn't like it.<br>

House of Boussé is a trans-forward drag house and they have an open mic in Café Kino that is strange, wonderful, inscrutable, delightful. It feels a little bit culty but like, in a good way. <br>
Drag can be a funny thing to try to define. The open mic is for any short form performance art by trans+ artists. I’ve seen comedy, music, horror, historical, and genre-defining <em>what-is-its</em> on What a Drag’s small stage and personally, I’m ready for more. </p>
<p>
<b>Last Wednesday</b> of the month, check at:

Café Kino is at: <address>108 Stokes Croft, Bristol BS1 3RU England</address><br>
Accessibility note: the performance is in the basement down some steep steps.

     <h3>About Schmidt</h3>
     <h4>2002</h4>
     <p>25 Jan 2026</p>
     </div>
     </div>

     

     <p>Boomer retires, loses wife, starts to unravel. With Jack Nickolson. Honestly, I was worried I would not like this one. An old white guy, comfortably middle class, can’t take care of himself, can’t stop himself from insulting and disappointing those around him. It’s tough to make a guy like that likeable.<br>
So why does it work?<br>
<img src="/images/aboutschmidt.jpg" clear=both><br></p>
<p>I read some writing advice once to the effect that your characters don’t have to be good at what they’re doing, but they have to give it what they got. A businessman trying to survive a plane crash in the desert even though he has 0 wilderness experience? Compelling. A teenager who can’t get out of a tight spot because, oops, she left her phone at home? Unacceptable!<br>
We understand the kind of man Schmidt is from the first few scenes. He works a boring corporate job, his wife has looked after him since he left home, he represses his emotions in the name of rationality. Yes, he messes everything up, but it’s because he really doesn’t have the basic life skills to keep his house tidy or feed himself, and he doesn’t have the emotional management and communication skills to navigate the conflicts he gets into. He’s never had to learn that stuff, but <em>he is giving it the best he’s got.</em><br>
And if that means loading up a supermarket trolley with frozen pizzas because that’s the only thing he knows how to cook, then he will do that with gusto. If the only way he can express his feelings about his future son-in-law is through explaining his dream about aliens, he’s going to give <em>that</em> his best shot.<br>
And I think that’s why we forgive him, even when he messes things up again and again. His character would normally be the obstacle in someone else’s story. He’s a side character turned main character, and somehow it works. <br>
The box was all about how funny it is, and it is, but the humour arises out of the absurdity, with occasional splashes of slapstick. The pace is slow. The frustration high. We both enjoyed it.<br><br></p>

     <h3>Murder Most Fab</h3>

<p>
Delightful, camp murder comedy about a young man on his way to super stardom who just keeps getting put into situations where he unfortunately has to murder other men. Woe is he.<br>
The character is a lot more sympathetic than I would have guessed from the premise, he's more of a lovable idiot than a magnificent bastard. It's sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, but the story is saved from nihilism by the character's enduring love for a YA summer romance. <br>
Best read of the year so far. (Yes, it's mid January, but still.) <br>

Fun watch! Some cool songs, mood-elevating dance scenes, and some real stars in “what are you doing here?” parts, who actually pull it all together.<br>
We have Christopher Walken as a joke-shop owner dad, Michelle Pfeiffer as the evil (former beauty) queen and, yeah, <em>John Travolta in drag?</em><br>
If you search for “Travolta Hairspray” google suggests asking <em>why’d he do it?</em> And I guess that was sort of my question. He’s a weird pick, for sure. And it’s for sure a brave move for him. But the really surprising bit is that he kinda knocks it out of the park!? Kinda!? <br>
My favourite scene was her and Christopher Walken singing about how much they love each other even though they’re a pair of old farts. Actually touching, but then I’m an old fart. <br>
The Guardian had a two star review, proving once and for all they’re a bunch of fuddy-duddies who hate fun.

I’ve been to PRSCs Collage Club twice, and I’ve had a good time twice. They provide boxes of magazines, newspaper, assorted printed stuff and you can do what you want with them. <br>
This time, I made some mini zine pages. I was planning to make a zine about how Instagram is eating your brain and you should leave, but decided against that at the last minute. With no plan whatsoever, I just cut interesting words out of magazine pages for a while, and made ransom note poetry. <br>
It turned into <a href="/pages/choose-horror-and-hysteria">a zine</a> after all. 
The vibe at Cut & Paste collage club is chill, you can talk to people or just do your own thing, and it’s on for long enough to really get stuck in, or to drop in for part of it and do something small.

     <h3>A Home of One&#39;s Own: Why the Housing Crisis Matters</h3>

<p>I wanted to dig a little deeper into some of the issues I care about. Rather than watching hypey 20 minute videos on Youtube, why don't I get a book out about e.g. the housing crisis in the UK? So I did that. <br>
Mohamed's writing is clear and damning: political failures across the board have created this crisis and let it fester. This isn't about Thatcher (although it's also about Thatcher), it's about a system that has failed at every opportunity to plan for the future. A Home of One's Own is a fairly quick read, but it touches on the major forces contributing to the lack of affordable, quality housing: the selling of council housing, nimbyism, foreign investment, a planning system that's not fit for purpose. Ultimately, it's conflicts of interest that keep this crisis unsolved: the powerful own houses, and benefit from the fact that others do not. <br>
It deepened my understanding, although it's light on solutions or, you know, hope. <br>Everything needs to change. Political will is in short supply. <br>
Gift this book to your parents or grandparents who don't understand.</p>

Toxic masculinity, the movie. Our hero is hanging out with a bunch of war criminals when Bjork reminds him he's supposed to avenge his father.<br>
He does, by sneaking around the hall killing men at night, like a ghost. This is the kind of stuff that made Grendel the bad guy, but I think we're still supposed to root for him?<br>
No "be or not to be" for this guy, he's here for his vengeance and he'll do anything to get it. What a waste. The witchy stuff was cool, the gore and violence got a bit much.<br> 
Not for me.

     <h3>Bury your Gays</h3>

I was new to Chuck Tingle, who also has a very sexy fiction podcast where his erotic stories are read by the people of Welcome to Nightvale (get that where-ever you get your podcasts). He’s good. I liked it. Blazed through it on a roadtrip.<br>
Bury your Gays is a very enjoyable, madcap Hollywood horror about the future of entertainment in the age of AI, being out, artistic integrity and the ghosts of the past. Well plotted, great cast, satisfying ending. No notes.

I was strongly recommended this and after trying to read it I didn’t want to ask why. <br>   
If I’m going to read a book with this much sadomasochistic sex, I’d like it if anyone was actually enjoying themselves.

     <h3>Detransition, Baby!</h3>

One of my top reads of 2025. The story is about a complex family trying to form: a detransitioned trans woman gets his boss pregnant and is asking his ex (a transwoman) to join them and be the second mother to the baby. <br>
Most of the book is actually the character’s back stories, how they got to be who they are and why this crazy premise actually makes a kind of sense, maybe. It’s very queer, it’s funny and sad and hopeful without sanding down the rough edges. <br>
I don’t identify as trans but reading this felt like a window into trans female experiences that an educational text just couldn't ever offer. And I value it deeply for that.

Ooh, #metoo fiction with some nuance and room for interpretation? In <em>this</em> timeline? <br>
This is a novella about a Bad Man that asks: but how bad? Where is the line and when did he cross it? <br>
Reading other reviews I can see they are all over the place. From sympathy for the Bad Man character to full throw-away-the-key condemnation. I think it’s a good book, it’s well written and I feel like I’m better for having read it.
