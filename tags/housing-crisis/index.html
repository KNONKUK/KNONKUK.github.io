     <h3>A Home of One&#39;s Own: Why the Housing Crisis Matters</h3>

     <p><em>finished <time datetime="2026-01-13">13/01/2026</time></em></p>
<p>I wanted to dig a little deeper into some of the issues I care about. Rather than watching hypey 20 minute videos on Youtube, why don't I get a book out about e.g. the housing crisis in the UK? So I did that. <br>
Mohamed's writing is clear and damning: political failures across the board have created this crisis and let it fester. This isn't about Thatcher (although it's also about Thatcher), it's about a system that has failed at every opportunity to plan for the future. A Home of One's Own is a fairly quick read, but it touches on the major forces contributing to the lack of affordable, quality housing: the selling of council housing, nimbyism, foreign investment, a planning system that's not fit for purpose. Ultimately, it's conflicts of interest that keep this crisis unsolved: the powerful own houses, and benefit from the fact that others do not. <br>
It deepened my understanding, although it's light on solutions or, you know, hope. <br>Everything needs to change. Political will is in short supply. <br>
Gift this book to your parents or grandparents who don't understand.</p>
