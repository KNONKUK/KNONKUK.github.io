     <h3>My Life as a Courgette</h3>
     <h4>2016</h4>
     <p>07 Feb 2026</p>
     </div>
     </div>

     

     <p>A cute French claymation that looks like a kid's film and is rated PG, but <em>holy crap is it dark</em>. <br>
The DVD case blithely notes that the main character goes to an orphanage after his parents die. It doesn't mention that his mother is a severe alcoholic who threatens to beat him and dies after he acidentally causes her to fall down the stairs. And he is but one of the seven-or-so severely traumatised 8-10 year olds that form the heart of this charming, colourful film. <br>
Is it a French thing?<br>
I'm not against challenging themes in kid's entertainment though, and it treats the kids and their strange behaviours with respect and a gentle hand. The characters are all multi-dimensional, even while made of clay. There's a bully, who turns out not to be all that bad, but also doesn't stop bullying just because they had a good talk. There's a girl with PTSD from unspecified parental abuse, whose mood can be read by how much hair covers up the scar on her face. And a girl who ended up in state care after her mother was deported to an African country, who rushes out the door with a "maman?" whenever a car approaches, but then when her mother does show up, she doesn't go with her.<br>
And, perhaps most surprisingly, we are trusted with these subtle characterisations, trusted to connect the dots and understand what's going on with these kids. Is <em>that</em> a French thing?Because I like it.<br>
Beautiful, slightly haunting.<br><br>

     <h3>Calendar Girls</h3>

     <p>Pleasant but silly film about middle aged women raising money for charity with a nude calendar. The jokes are mild, the drama is forced, and the whole thing would have been a yawn-fest except for Helen Mirren. I just love her.</p>

     <h3>About Schmidt</h3>
     <h4>2002</h4>
     <p>25 Jan 2026</p>
     </div>
     </div>

     

     <p>Boomer retires, loses wife, starts to unravel. With Jack Nickolson. Honestly, I was worried I would not like this one. An old white guy, comfortably middle class, can’t take care of himself, can’t stop himself from insulting and disappointing those around him. It’s tough to make a guy like that likeable.<br>
So why does it work?<br>
<img src="/images/aboutschmidt.jpg" clear=both><br></p>
<p>I read some writing advice once to the effect that your characters don’t have to be good at what they’re doing, but they have to give it what they got. A businessman trying to survive a plane crash in the desert even though he has 0 wilderness experience? Compelling. A teenager who can’t get out of a tight spot because, oops, she left her phone at home? Unacceptable!<br>
We understand the kind of man Schmidt is from the first few scenes. He works a boring corporate job, his wife has looked after him since he left home, he represses his emotions in the name of rationality. Yes, he messes everything up, but it’s because he really doesn’t have the basic life skills to keep his house tidy or feed himself, and he doesn’t have the emotional management and communication skills to navigate the conflicts he gets into. He’s never had to learn that stuff, but <em>he is giving it the best he’s got.</em><br>
And if that means loading up a supermarket trolley with frozen pizzas because that’s the only thing he knows how to cook, then he will do that with gusto. If the only way he can express his feelings about his future son-in-law is through explaining his dream about aliens, he’s going to give <em>that</em> his best shot.<br>
And I think that’s why we forgive him, even when he messes things up again and again. His character would normally be the obstacle in someone else’s story. He’s a side character turned main character, and somehow it works. <br>
The box was all about how funny it is, and it is, but the humour arises out of the absurdity, with occasional splashes of slapstick. The pace is slow. The frustration high. We both enjoyed it.<br><br></p>

Fun watch! Some cool songs, mood-elevating dance scenes, and some real stars in “what are you doing here?” parts, who actually pull it all together.<br>
We have Christopher Walken as a joke-shop owner dad, Michelle Pfeiffer as the evil (former beauty) queen and, yeah, <em>John Travolta in drag?</em><br>
If you search for “Travolta Hairspray” google suggests asking <em>why’d he do it?</em> And I guess that was sort of my question. He’s a weird pick, for sure. And it’s for sure a brave move for him. But the really surprising bit is that he kinda knocks it out of the park!? Kinda!? <br>
My favourite scene was her and Christopher Walken singing about how much they love each other even though they’re a pair of old farts. Actually touching, but then I’m an old fart. <br>
The Guardian had a two star review, proving once and for all they’re a bunch of fuddy-duddies who hate fun.

Toxic masculinity, the movie. Our hero is hanging out with a bunch of war criminals when Bjork reminds him he's supposed to avenge his father.<br>
He does, by sneaking around the hall killing men at night, like a ghost. This is the kind of stuff that made Grendel the bad guy, but I think we're still supposed to root for him?<br>
No "be or not to be" for this guy, he's here for his vengeance and he'll do anything to get it. What a waste. The witchy stuff was cool, the gore and violence got a bit much.<br> 
Not for me.
